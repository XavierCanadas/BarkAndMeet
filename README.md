# bark and meet

## Project description
A Flutter app developed for the "Software engineering" course at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. 
Designed as a social network for dog owners to connect with nearby dogs. It includes a main "match" screen to connect compatible dogs, a chat feature, and a user profile.

My Key Contributions:

- App Architecture: Designed the complete app architecture in Flutter, applying prior iOS experience and utilizing GitHub Copilot, achieving full implementation in just 5 days.
- Dynamic View Transformation: Converted static views designed by the team into fully functional, dynamic interfaces, optimizing the integration between the UI and app logic.
- Firebase Integration: Configured Firebase Authentication for login, Firestore for managing user, dog, and chat data, and Cloud Storage for multimedia content.
